👋 Hi, I’m Ankan Kushwaha

I’m a computer science student and developer focused on backend development and core programming.
I enjoy breaking down problems, writing structured code, and gradually turning concepts into working systems.

🎯 Current Focus

Strengthening Data Structures & Algorithms using C++ and Java

Building backend applications with Java & Spring Boot

Improving understanding of system-level fundamentals (memory, processes, APIs)

Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code

I don’t chase tools blindly — I focus on fundamentals that scale.

🧠 Technical Skill Set
Core Programming

Java – OOP, collections, exception handling

C & C++ – memory, pointers, problem solving

Python – scripting & basics

Backend & Databases

Spring / Spring Boot

RESTful APIs

MySQL (queries, schema design)

Frontend (Supporting Skills)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Responsive layouts & basic UI logic

Tools

Git & GitHub (version control, collaboration)

VS Code, Eclipse IDE

MySQL Workbench, Excel

🛠️ What I’m Building

Backend-driven projects using Spring Boot

Practice-driven DSA implementations

Small but complete applications (not half-done demos)
